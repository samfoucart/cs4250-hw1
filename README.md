# CS4250 Homework 1
## Overview
Drone

## Installation Instructions
In the project root directory, the most common way to build and run a cmake project is to type:

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

cd ..

./build/hw0



But a makefile is provided in the project build directory just in case. NOTE: The project should be run from the project build directory, NOT the build directory, or else the shaders will not be able to be found, compiled, and linked.
